In this repository i solved the logic building question from basic to advanced.I solved questions from last few months but i think that i also upload it in my github repo. so i can access it from anywhere eventhough i have to perform any changes in it so it can be easily done.


Rules before solve any problem
1.See problem  2.Understand it   3.Solve 


In every file we solve 2-3 basic question initially and after that we'll go to medium questions and then advanced.
